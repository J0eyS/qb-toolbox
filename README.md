# qb-toolbox
This is an basic Qb-Core framework  "admin" menu for FiveM
its one of my first scripts and its stil not done but i will share my devolopment progress here.
Its using:
MenuV
K5_notify



As this is my first script it is basic and i used ChatGPT 3.5 To help me where i got stuck.
The code is bit messy but i will fix that on the way.
